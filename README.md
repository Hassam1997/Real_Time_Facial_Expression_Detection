## Introduction

Facial expression recognition is the process of identifying human emotions based on facial expressions. This project utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect and classify facial expressions in real-time. It can recognize seven basic emotions: angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, and neutral.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-facial-expression.git
   ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd real-time-facial-expression

2. Run the real-time facial expression recognition script:
   This will open your webcam feed and display real-time facial expression recognition results.

To exit the program, press 'q' on your keyboard.
